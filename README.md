# Linux-projects-for-LPIC-certification
Welcome to my Linux Projects for LPIC Certification repository! This is a collection of the Linux projects and exercises I have worked on as part of my study for the LPIC-1 and LPIC-2 certifications. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my hands-on work and demonstrate my skills in Linux system administration, networking, security, and other key areas required for the LPIC exams.

Projects
LPIC-1 Projects
User Management: In this project, I created scripts and configurations for managing users, groups, and file permissions in Linux.
Package Management: I documented commands and methods for installing, updating, and removing software packages on Linux systems.
Networking Basics: I configured network interfaces, assigned IP addresses, and troubleshoot network-related issues.
System Startup: I learned how to manage the Linux boot process, including understanding runlevels and system services.
LPIC-2 Projects
Kernel Management: In this section, I worked on managing and updating the Linux kernel, compiling custom kernels, and troubleshooting kernel-related issues.
System Security: I focused on securing Linux systems by setting up firewalls, securing SSH access, and applying best security practices.
Automation: I created Bash scripts to automate tasks such as backups, log management, and system monitoring.
Disk Management and RAID: I worked with disk partitions, file systems, and configured RAID arrays to provide system redundancy.
